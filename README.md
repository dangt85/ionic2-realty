## IonicRealty: Ionic 2 Sample App

1. Install the the latest beta version of the Ionic CLI:
    ```
    npm install -g ionic@beta
    ```
    
1. Create a project:
    ```
    ionic start IonicRealty sidemenu --v2
    ```

1. Replace the projectâ€™s app folder with the app folder in this repository

1. Navigate to the IonicRealty directory:
    ```
    cd IonicRealty
    ```
    
1. Start the app in the browser
    ```
    ionic serve
    ```
    
From here, you can build and deploy the app on different platforms using the traditional Ionic commands (`ionic build ios`, etc.)
