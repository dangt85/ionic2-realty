## IonicRealty: Ionic 2 Sample App

1. Install the the latest beta version of the Ionic CLI:
    ```
    npm i -g ionic@beta
    ```

1. Clone this repository into your local file system:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/dangt85/ionic2-realty.git
    ```

1. Navigate to the IonicRealty directory:
    ```
    cd ionic2-realty
    ```

1. Install all dependencies:
    ```
    npm i
    ```

1. Start the app in the browser
    ```
